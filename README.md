# math-exercices

Quiz-based math exercises using a Python terminal UI.

## ⭐ Idea

I was inspired by Khan academy, I usually love this website but the lack of content there really pmo once, I understand that's it's a non-profit so I have no right to be mad, but after seeing that there were no exercices for base conversion for me, I decided to make my own since it can't be that hard.

## 📺 Demo

- Navigate mcq answers -> `Up arrow key`, `Down arrow key`
- Confirm an answer -> `Enter`
- Yes/No answers -> `Y`, `N`
- Quit -> `Esc` (or select `N` when prompted to leave)
