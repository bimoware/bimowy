- Add options on all math exercises, variations (quiz with selected options, free & open variation)
- Add many other math exercises (Expression simplification, Equation solving, Limits, matrix, probability etc..)
- Add physic problems (Forces, work, energy, acceleration, velocity, displacement etc..) 
- Add a python (and other programming languages) exercises (code fixing, optimization)
- Add other resource types (Courses, Tools, Articles (like brilliant.org vertical articles), videos with annoations etc..)
- Add Account system (friend tracking, personal progress tracking w/ charts) for better gamified experience
- Add a way for users to submit their own exercises and content (like scratch w drag n drop or just github pull requests)
- Add a way for users to create & save custom quizzes with selected exercises and options
- Add a way for users to discuss exercises and content (comments, forums)
- Add components (matrix, graph plotting, plane, 3D space, geometric shapes, etc..)
- Add "warnings" on exercise solutions instead of black and white correct & incorrect (incorrect sign, common mistakes, aproximations, significant figures in physics lol faut vrm etre un troudballe pour encore oublier ca)
- i18n
- More persona-5 like UI/UX (non-boxy design, more micro animations)
- Sound effects & input micro animation when correct/incorrect/warning
- More typescript-safe code on /src/lib/resources/list/*, currently no typescript safety so the code DST can be broken easily if not careful
- Better inputs (code editor for programming, matrix editor, graph points & vectors & polygons, function plotting, table cells, latex elements inputs, etc..)
- Resource search & tags
- API for 3rd party developers to create their own resources, or use the current ones
- Challenge mode (two friends challenge themselves in the same resource group)
- Zod schemas for everything
- unit test for all exercises
- keyboard shortcuts for navigating easily
- Anti-AI copy paste
- Hand-made latex renderer
- Moderation?
- UI Editor for authoring resource

Of course I don't expect to do it all. But each step is a big step for interactive and curious learning :3
