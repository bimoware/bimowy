# bimowy

Quiz-based math exercises using a Python terminal UI.

## ‚≠ê Idea
<div align="left">
I was inspired by Khan academy, I usually love this website but the lack of content there really pmo once, I understand that's it's a non-profit so I have no right to be mad, but after seeing that there were no exercices for base conversion for me, I decided to make my own since it can't be that hard.
