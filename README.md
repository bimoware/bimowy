If you don't like using your mouse like me, just press <code>Enter</code> and the website will know what to do (Start/Next/Try again/End/Focus on the next input etc..)

# ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

1. Clone the repository with either
   - [Using `git clone` or the green download button `Code` on top](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
   - [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
2. Create a supabase database and put the correct environement variables into an `.env` file (you have the copy & rename [`.env.example`](.env.example))
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`
5. If you want to seriously test the website, use `npm run build`, then `npm run start`, this will make the whole server work extremely fast allowing you to test the platform with ease.
