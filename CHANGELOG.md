# 23/02/2025

## Added TODOs:

- [✅] Make "types" of questions, as in 0: Input, 1: "Multiple Choice"
- [✅] "type" of question boolean (True/False)
- [✅] TODO 2: Make it so that when an answer is false, it doesn't get validated on "prompt" and the user can try again (but still, the variable "correct_on_first_try" keeps it's purpose).
- [✅] TODO 3: Make sure question answers don't repeat (review generating questions)
- [✅] TODO 4: More questions. And more "manually" created questions for pattern-recognition testing.
- [ ] TODO 5: More subjects (Set theory, logic, etc... Khan academy for inspiration)
- [ ] TODO 6: Programming subjects maybe? idk
- [ ] TODO 7: Add a "score" system, where the user can see how well they did on each subject (db.json file)
- [ ] TODO 8: Add a "difficulty" system, where the user can choose the difficulty of the questions from Easy to Medium to Hard to Evil (either the questions get more compactly complex, not just too long, or just the subject gets more complicated like 1+1 -> 4-8 + 2/2) (Also saved on db.json file)
- [ ] TODO 9: Give the ability to stop the quiz at any time/skip a question and get marked as false
- [ ] TODO 10: Show the detailed answer to the user after they answer/skip the question
- [ ] TODO 11: Add a "hint" system, where the user can ask for a hint on the question
- [ ] TODO 12: Add a "skip" system, where the user can skip the question
- [ ] TODO 13: Lessons system, where the user can learn the subject before taking the quiz
- [ ] TODO 14: General Math Quiz, where the user can get quizzed on general questions (systems of questions, real-world geometry problems)
- [ ] TODO 15: Bookark system, where the user can bookmark a subject
- [ ] TODO 16: Find a better more modular way to run the gen.py file
- [✅] TODO 17: Decide if running main in defs if run as the main program is actually necessary
